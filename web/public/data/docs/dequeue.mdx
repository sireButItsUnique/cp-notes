# Dequeue
---
## Definition
A dequeue is a double ended queue, combining a stack with a queue. This means you can `push`
and `pop` from both the front and the back, which is useful for making it [monotonic](/docs/monotonic)
as you can create a "monotonic queue".

&nbsp;

Use `std::dequeue`, with the usual
- `.push_front()`
- `.push_back()`
- `.pop_front()`
- `.pop_back()`

&nbsp;

## Complexity
- Pop: `O(1)`
- Push: `O(1)`
- Read: `O(1)`
