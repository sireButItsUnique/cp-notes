# Dynamic Programming
---

## Definition
Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

&nbsp;

## Implementation
Dynamic Programming can be implemented using either top-down (recursion + memoization) or 
bottom-up (iterative + tabulation). Generally top-down is easier to code, but bottom-up is more efficient.

&nbsp;

Both methods require the definition of a state transition function, which describes how the solution to a problem
can be constructed from the solutions to its subproblems. To do this you need to keep track of state, or variables
that define the problem.

## Tips
- Check the dp transition carefully, rubber duck debug if necessary (vpex1p4)
