## Language
### Preface
> You are free to use whatever language you want, however there are only three languages
which platforms consistently accept: C/C++, Java, and Python.
>
### C++
> This is the gold standard for cp, as it has a powerful std which is universally accepted as well
as having the advantage of being a "faster" language. Of course this is based on the code you write,
but for the same logic it will generally be multiple times faster than its interpreted python counterpart.
>
> To use it in a contest, just use a file with a .cpp extension. However, in 99% of cases, you want to test your code
before submitting to a judge. Thus you should compile it yourself and run it given testcases using `g++` from 
[mingw](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/)

## The std
### Use \<bits/std++.h>
> That's it. The line `#include <bits/std++.h>` at the top of your file will grant access
to the entire std libaray. This is incredibly well documented, with every single function
having a comprehensive explaination from prying open the behind the scenes implementation to bizzare
hacks. I won't waste my time explaining it, but sites like [cppreference](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/)
and [w3schools](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/) are a great way to learn about a specific function.
