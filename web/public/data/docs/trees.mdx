# Tree Tricks
---
## Definition  
A tree is a connected, acyclic graph with `n` nodes and `n - 1` edges. 
This means that from every node to every other node there is exactly one path.
In directed trees, we call the node with no parents the *root* whilst the nodes
with no children are called *leaf*

&nbsp;

Because of how easy it is to traverse, it is sometimes valid to create an 
*Minimum Spanning Tree* using [DSU](/docs/dsu) to calculate answers

## Concepts
The diameter of a tree is the longest path between any two nodes. To find it,
1. Start at any node `u` and perform a DFS to find the farthest node `v` from `u`  
2. Perform another DFS starting from `v` to find the farthest node `w` from `v`  
3. The distance between `v` and `w` must be diameter.  
<br/>
*The implementation is left as an excerise to the reader.

### Depth
The depth of a tree is the longest path from the root to any leaf node. To find it,
1. Start at node root and traverse down tree (dfs/bfs both are fine)
2. Update with `depth = max(depth, curDepth)`

### Traversal
Given the properties of trees, traversal is efficient to calculate:
1. Single Path Property: By definition, there is **exactly one unique path** between any two nodes and thus simply use DFS.  
2. Complete Tree Traversal:  
   - To traverse the entire tree and **return** to the starting node: `dist = 2n`
   - To traverse the entire tree starting from an **ideal node** (lowest dist): `dist = 2n - diameter`
   - To traverse the entire tree starting from the **root**: `dist = 2n - depth`
