# Dijkstra's Algorithm
---

## Definition
Dijkstra's Algorithm is a a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path from a single source node 
to all other nodes in the graph by building a shortest-path tree using a priority queue. Note this means
it's just a weighted BFS.

## Application
The more important part is how to model the graph questions to fit Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Shortest path surprisingly common (e.g. [cf 2024 D](https://codeforces.com/contest/2024/problem/D)), you just
need to see the graph in some cases where it's not immediately obvious.

&nbsp;

You also need to limit dijkstra sometimes, since you want to optimize one variable but keep another within a certain range.
For example ccc15s4, leetcode plane ticket thing, and ccc23s4

## Tricks
- You can combine distances in equation to abstractify -> dist(a, b) + dist(b, c) = dist(a, c) (e.g. [dmopc21c9p3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/dmopc21c9p3))
- You can start from multiple sources and run Dijkstra's Algorithm
- You can start from both the start and the end if it's necessary to go through a certain node (kind of like first note)
