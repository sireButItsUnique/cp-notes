## Approach
In general, ad hoc problems are those that don't fit into any other category. They require noticing a particular
pattern or property, which once you find trivializes the problem. The key to solving ad hoc problems is to 
think outside the box and come up with a unique solution that may not be immediately obvious.
<br/>
A trick is to brute force to find pattern. Needless to say, always manually find patterns with paper & WRITE IT OUT.
You should also have clear variable naming when implementing, write what each variable does since 
a lot of the time it gets abstracted

## Finding patterns
THERES ALWAYS SOME STUPID PATTERN, THINK ABOUT WHAT ALL CONDITIONS IMPLY (usaco21jans3)
