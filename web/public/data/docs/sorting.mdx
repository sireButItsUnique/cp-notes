# Sorting
---
## Definition
Sorting is a method to avoid having `O(n^2)` complexity by needing to compare
all pairs in an array. This is useful in a couple of senarios: 
* When you know the optimal solution must only exist between elements which are "close" to each other,
e.g. [min difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-difference/description/)
* When used for [greedy](/docs/greedy) algorithms, frequently creating one pass solutions
* When it allows for a systematic approach combined with some other pattern, e.g. [two pointers](/docs/twopointers) in [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

<br/>
Note it also allows for `O(logn)` [binary searching](/docs/binarysearch), but unless you need consequtive searches it's usually better
to just take the lazy `O(n)` linear search approach.

<br />
You sort in C++ by using `std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end())` where `arr` is your array. Note you can sort backwards either via a
(custom comparator)[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-sort-vector-using-custom-comparator-in-cpp/] or using `std::sort(arr.rbegin(), arr.rend())`
You can also sort only a section of the array by passing the appropriate iterators, such as sorting the first `n` 
elements using `std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + n)`

## Example
<div className="language-cpp">
```c++ 
// Given data
vector<int> arr = {32208, 33647, 50, 32589, 33318, 32208, 33039};

// Sort the data
sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

// Sort the data backwards
sort(arr.rbegin(), arr.rend());

// Sort only the last four elements
sort(arr.end() - 4, arr.end());

// Sort by their last digit (USE STATIC COMPARATORS!)
static bool cmp(int& a, int& b) {
    string astr = to_string(a);
    string bstr = to_string(b);
    return astr.back() < bstr.back();
}
sort(arr.begin(), arr.end(), cmp);
```
</div>
