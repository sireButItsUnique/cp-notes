# Monotonic Data Structures
---
## Definition
Monotonic data structures, such as monotonic stacks and monotonic deques, are 
data structures that maintain elements in a specific order. They allow for efficient 
retrieval of minimum or maximum values, making them particularly useful in problems involving 
sliding windows, nearest smaller/larger elements.

<br/>

Whenever a new element is added, steps must be taken to ensure the structure is still monotonic.
For verbosity purposes, the following example will be for a `min` stack/queue:
1. Popping
    - While the lastest element added is bigger *(or equal in some cases)* to your value
    - Pop the latest element; `pop` for stack, `pop_back` for dequeue
2. Pushing
    - Push your new value. It is guranteed to be either the only element or larger than its predecessor

## Example
To keep track of max in sliding window:
<div className="language-cpp">
```c++ 
// Given data
vector<int> arr = {1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7};
int k = 3;
vector<int> result;
deque<int> dq;

for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
    // Remove elements outside the window
    if (!dq.empty() && dq.front() <= i - k) {
        dq.pop_front();
    }
    
    // Maintain elements in decreasing order in the deque
    while (!dq.empty() && arr[dq.back()] < arr[i]) {
        dq.pop_back();
    }
    
    dq.push_back(i); // Add current index to the deque

    // Store the maximum for the current window
    result.push_back(arr[dq.front()]); // Front is the maximum
}
```
</div>
