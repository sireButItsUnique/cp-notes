# Factorial Arithmetic
---
## Definition
`!` is an operator seen in some math type problems. If you don't know what
factorial is, go read a book.

&nbsp;

We almost never want to actually calculate `n!` in a problem since you need unrealistically
large integers to represent it, thus we usually loop through all of its multiplicators and apply properties.
For example, to check how many trailing 0s there are in `n!`, we could naively loop from 1 to `n` and count the
factors of 5. The more efficient way is shown below.

&nbsp;

## Example
<div className="language-cpp">
```c++ 
// To count number of 5s in n!
int res = 0;
for (int i = 5; n / i; i *= 5) {
    res += (n / i);
}
```
</div>

&nbsp;

## Properties
- `n!` Can only be calculated in `O(n)` time
- You can count the number of factors in `n!` with a for loop
