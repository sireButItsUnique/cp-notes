# AND Operations
---
## Definition
`AND` is a bitwise operator which will take two pieces of data;
returning only the bits where the two overlap.

&nbsp;

As such, it is commonly used to check for a single bit in a piece of data. Create a mask
consiting of a single bit then `AND` the two together; if the bit was 0 you will receieve
0, otherwise the bitmask will be returned.

&nbsp;

It's also used to find the rightmost bit of a number, by `AND`ing the number with the negative of itself.
Since `-x = !x + 1`, the rightmost bit will be the only bit that is the same in both the number and its negative. 

## Example
<div className="language-cpp">
```c++ 
// Given data (10011)
int number == 19; 

// Create mask (10000)
int mask = 1 << 4;

// To query (e.g. 5th bit of number, should return 10000)
number & mask;
```
</div>

&nbsp;

## Properties
- `AND` of two distinct numbers will ALWAYS return a number that is less than both
