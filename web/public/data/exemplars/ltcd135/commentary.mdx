&nbsp;
## Observations
- Kids with lower ratings than both neighbours only need one candy
- Kids only care about their immediate neighbours

## Approach
- Greedy approach; start every kids at 1 candy
- Iterate left to right in `[1, n]`
    - Give kids with higher ratings than their left neighbour one more than their neighbour
- Iterate right to left in `[n-1, 0]`
    - Give kids with higher ratings than their right neighbour one more than their neighbour
    - Only do so if they currently have less or equal candies than their right neighbour
- Note after only these two pases we will be done; think of `ratings` as a series of peaks, 
no conflicts will arise
