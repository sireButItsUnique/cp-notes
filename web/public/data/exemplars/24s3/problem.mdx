Canadian Computing Competition: 2024 Stage 1, Senior #3
Swipe is a new mobile game that has recently exploded in popularity. In each level of Swipe, you are given 
 rows of integers that can be represented as arrays 
 and 
 of size 
. The objective of Swipe is to beat each level by turning array 
 into array 
.

There are two swipe operations you can perform on array 
.

Swipe right: Select the subarray 
 and set 
 for all 
.
Swipe left: Select the subarray 
 and set 
 for all 
.
For example, starting with array 
, if we swipe right on 
, we would obtain the array 
. If instead, we started with the same array A, and swiped left on 
, we would obtain the array 
. Note that these arrays are 0-indexed.

Unfortunately, the game is bugged and contains levels that are impossible to beat. Determine if it is possible to transform array 
 into array 
. If it is possible, determine a sequence of swipe operations that transforms array 
 into array 
.

Input Specification
The first line of input will consist of one positive integer 
, representing the length of each of the two arrays of integers.

The second line of input contains 
 space separated integers contained in array 
.

The third line of input contains 
 space separated integers contained in array 
.

The following table shows how the available 15 marks are distributed:
